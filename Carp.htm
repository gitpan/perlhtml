DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
The Carp routines are useful in your own modules because
they act like 
<A HREF="perlfunc.htm#perlfunc_die_0">die()</A>
 or 
<A HREF="perlfunc.htm#perlfunc_warn_0">warn()</A>
, but report where the error
was in the code they were called from.  Thus if you have a 
routine <EM>Foo()</EM> that has a <EM>carp()</EM> in it, then the <EM>carp()</EM> 
will report the error as occurring where <EM>Foo()</EM> was called, 
not where <EM>carp()</EM> was called.
