DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
This utility takes a list of libraries in the form C<-llib1 -llib2
-llib3&gt; and prints out lines suitable for inclusion in an extension
Makefile.  Extra library paths may be included with the form
<CODE>-L/another/path</CODE> this will affect the searches for all subsequent
libraries.
<p>It returns an array of four scalar values: EXTRALIBS, BSLOADLIBS,
LDLOADLIBS, and LD_RUN_PATH.
<p>Dependent libraries can be linked in one of three ways:
<p>
<DL>
<DT>

<STRONG>
<EM>* For static extensions</EM>
</DT></STRONG>
<DD>
by the ld command when the perl binary is linked with the extension
library. See EXTRALIBS below.
<p>
<DT>

<STRONG>
<EM>* For dynamic extensions</EM>
</DT></STRONG>
<DD>
by the ld command when the shared object is built/linked. See
LDLOADLIBS below.
<p>
<DT>

<STRONG>
<EM>* For dynamic extensions</EM>
</DT></STRONG>
<DD>
by the DynaLoader when the shared object is loaded. See BSLOADLIBS
below.

<A NAME="ExtUtils::Liblist_extralibs_0">
EXTRALIBS</A>
</H2>
List of libraries that need to be linked with when linking a perl
binary which includes this extension Only those libraries that
actually exist are included.  These are written to a file and used
when linking perl.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="ExtUtils::Liblist_ldloadlibs_0">
LDLOADLIBS and LD_RUN_PATH</A>
</H2>
List of those libraries which can or must be linked into the shared
library when created using ld. These may be static or dynamic
libraries.  LD_RUN_PATH is a colon separated list of the directories
in LDLOADLIBS. It is passed as an environment variable to the process
that links the shared library.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="ExtUtils::Liblist_bsloadlibs_0">
BSLOADLIBS</A>
</H2>
List of those libraries that are needed but can be linked in
dynamically at run time on this platform.  SunOS/Solaris does not need
this because ld records the information (from LDLOADLIBS) into the
object file.  This list is used to create a .bs (bootstrap) file.

PORTABILITY</A>
</H1>
This module deals with a lot of system dependencies and has quite a
few architecture specific <STRONG>if</STRONG>s in the code.
