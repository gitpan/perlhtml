DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
A <CODE>SelectSaver</CODE> object contains a reference to the file handle that
was selected when it was created.  If its <CODE>new</CODE> method gets an extra
parameter, then that parameter is selected; otherwise, the selected
file handle remains unchanged.
<p>When a <CODE>SelectSaver</CODE> is destroyed, it re-selects the file handle
that was selected when it was created.
