CAVEAT SCRIPTOR</A>
</H1>
Overloading of operators is a subject not to be taken lightly.
Neither its precise implementation, syntax, nor semantics are
100<STRONG>% </STRONG>endorsed by Larry Wall.  So any of these may be changed 
at some point in the future.

DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="overload_declaration_0">
Declaration of overloaded functions</A>
</H2>
The compilation directive
<p>
<XMP>
    package Number;
    use overload
        "+" => \&add, 
        "*=" => "muas";

</XMP>
<p>declares function Number::<EM>add()</EM> for addition, and method <EM>muas()</EM> in
the ``class'' <CODE>Number</CODE> (or one of its base classes)
for the assignment form <CODE>*=</CODE> of multiplication.  
<p>Arguments of this directive come in (key, value) pairs.  Legal values
are values legal inside a <CODE>&amp;{ ... }</CODE> call, so the name of a subroutine,
a reference to a subroutine, or an anonymous subroutine will all work.
Legal keys are listed below.
<p>The subroutine <CODE>add</CODE> will be called to execute <CODE><STRONG>$a</STRONG>+<STRONG>$b</STRONG></CODE> if <STRONG>$a</STRONG>
is a reference to an object blessed into the package <CODE>Number</CODE>, or if <STRONG>$a</STRONG> is
not an object from a package with defined mathemagic addition, but <STRONG>$b</STRONG> is a
reference to a <CODE>Number</CODE>.  It can also be called in other situations, like
<CODE><STRONG>$a</STRONG>+=7</CODE>, or <CODE><STRONG>$a</STRONG>++</CODE>.  See 
<A HREF="overload.htm#overload_magic_0"><EM>MAGIC AUTOGENERATION</EM></A>
.  (Mathemagical
methods refer to methods triggered by an overloaded mathematical
operator.)
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="overload_calling_0">
Calling Conventions for Binary Operations</A>
</H2>
The functions specified in the 
<A HREF="perlfunc.htm#perlfunc_use_1">use overload ...</A>
 directive are called
with three (in one particular case with four, see 
<A HREF="overload.htm#overload_last_0"><EM>Last Resort</EM></A>
)
arguments.  If the corresponding operation is binary, then the first
two arguments are the two arguments of the operation.  However, due to
general object calling conventions, the first argument should always be
an object in the package, so in the situation of <CODE>7+<STRONG>$a</STRONG></CODE>, the
order of the arguments is interchanged.  It probably does not matter
when implementing the addition method, but whether the arguments
are reversed is vital to the subtraction method.  The method can
query this information by examining the third argument, which can take
three different values:
<p>
<DL>
<DT>

<STRONG>

<A NAME="overload_false_0">
FALSE</A>

</DT></STRONG>
<DD>
the order of arguments is as in the current operation.
<p>
<DT>

<STRONG>

<A NAME="overload_true_0">
TRUE</A>

</DT></STRONG>
<DD>
the arguments are reversed.
<p>
<DT>

<STRONG>

<A NAME="overload_undef_0">
undef</A>

</DT></STRONG>
<DD>
the current operation is an assignment variant (as in
<CODE><STRONG>$a</STRONG>+=7</CODE>), but the usual function is called instead.  This additional
information can be used to generate some optimizations.
<p>
</DL>

<H2> 
<A NAME="overload_calling_1">
Calling Conventions for Unary Operations</A>
</H2>
Unary operation are considered binary operations with the second
argument being 
<A HREF="overload.htm#overload_undef_0">undef</A>
.  Thus the functions that overloads <CODE>{``++''}</CODE>
is called with arguments <CODE>(<STRONG>$a</STRONG>,undef,'')</CODE> when <STRONG>$a</STRONG>++ is executed.

<H1> SPECIAL SYMBOLS FOR 
<A NAME="perlfunc_use_1">

Three keys are recognized by Perl that are not covered by the above
description.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="overload_last_0">
Last Resort</A>
</H2>
<CODE>``nomethod''</CODE> should be followed by a reference to a function of four
parameters.  If defined, it is called when the overloading mechanism
cannot find a method for some operation.  The first three arguments of
this function coincide with the arguments for the corresponding method if
it were found, the fourth argument is the symbol
corresponding to the missing method.  If several methods are tried,
the last one is used.  Say, <CODE>1-<STRONG>$a</STRONG></CODE> can be equivalent to
<p>
<XMP>
        &nomethodMethod($a,1,1,"-")

</XMP>
<p>if the pair <CODE>``nomethod'' =&gt; ``nomethodMethod''</CODE> was specified in the

<A HREF="perlfunc.htm#perlfunc_use_1">use overload</A>
 directive.
<p>If some operation cannot be resolved, and there is no function
assigned to <CODE>``nomethod''</CODE>, then an exception will be raised via 
<A HREF="perlfunc.htm#perlfunc_die_0">die()</A>
--
unless <CODE>``fallback''</CODE> was specified as a key in 
<A HREF="perlfunc.htm#perlfunc_use_1">use overload</A>
 directive.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="overload_fallback_0">

The key <CODE>``fallback''</CODE> governs what to do if a method for a particular
operation is not found.  Three different cases are possible depending on
the value of <CODE>``fallback''</CODE>:

<DD>
Perl tries to use a
substituted method (see 
<A HREF="overload.htm#overload_magic_0"><EM>MAGIC AUTOGENERATION</EM></A>
).  If this fails, it
then tries to calls <CODE>``nomethod''</CODE> value; if missing, an exception
will be raised.
<p>
<DT>

<STRONG>
<EM>* TRUE</EM>
</DT></STRONG>
<DD>
The same as for the 
<A HREF="overload.htm#overload_undef_0">undef</A>
 value, but no exception is raised.  Instead,
it silently reverts to what it would have done were there no 
<A HREF="perlfunc.htm#perlfunc_use_1">use overload</A>

present.
<p>
<DT>

<STRONG>
<EM>* defined, but FALSE</EM>
</DT></STRONG>
<DD>
No autogeneration is tried.  Perl tries to call
<CODE>``nomethod''</CODE> value, and if this is missing, raises an exception. 
<p>
</DL>

<H2> 
<A NAME="overload_copy_0">
Copy Constructor</A>
</H2>
The value for <CODE>``=''</CODE> is a reference to a function with three
arguments, i.e., it looks like the other values in C<use
overload&gt;. However, it does not overload the Perl assignment
operator. This would go against Camel hair.
<p>This operation is called in the situations when a mutator is applied
to a reference that shares its object with some other reference, such
as
<p>
<XMP>
        $a=$b; 
        $a++;

</XMP>
<p>To make this change <STRONG>$a</STRONG> and not change <STRONG>$b</STRONG>, a copy of <CODE>
<A HREF="perlvar.htm#perlvar__23">$$</A>
a</CODE> is made,
and <STRONG>$a</STRONG> is assigned a reference to this new object.  This operation is
done during execution of the <CODE><STRONG>$a</STRONG>++</CODE>, and not during the assignment,
(so before the increment <CODE>
<A HREF="perlvar.htm#perlvar__23">$$</A>
a</CODE> coincides with <CODE>
<A HREF="perlvar.htm#perlvar__23">$$</A>
b</CODE>).  This is only
done if <CODE>++</CODE> is expressed via a method for <CODE>'++'</CODE> or <CODE>'+='</CODE>.  Note
that if this operation is expressed via <CODE>'+'</CODE> a nonmutator, i.e., as
in
<p>
<XMP>
        $a=$b; 
        $a=$a+1;

</XMP>
<p>then <CODE><STRONG>$a</STRONG></CODE> does not reference a new copy of <CODE>
<A HREF="perlvar.htm#perlvar__23">$$</A>
a</CODE>, since 
<A HREF="perlvar.htm#perlvar__23">$$</A>
a does not
appear as lvalue when the above code is executed.
<p>If the copy constructor is required during the execution of some mutator,
but a method for <CODE>'='</CODE> was not specified, it can be autogenerated as a
string copy if the object is a plain scalar.

If a method for an operation is not found, and the value for  <CODE>``fallback''</CODE> is

WARNING</A>

The restriction for the comparison operation is that even if, for example,
`<CODE>cmp</CODE>' should return a blessed reference, the autogenerated `<CODE>lt</CODE>'
function will produce only a standard logical value based on the
numerical value of the result of `<CODE>cmp</CODE>'.  In particular, a working
numeric conversion is needed in this case (possibly expressed in terms of
other conversions).
<p>Similarly, <CODE>.=</CODE>  and <CODE>x=</CODE> operators lose their mathemagical properties
if the string conversion substitution is applied.

<A NAME="overload_implementation_0">
IMPLEMENTATION</A>
</H1>
What follows is subject to change RSN.
<p>The table of methods for all operations is cached as magic in the
symbol table hash for the package.  The table is rechecked for changes due to

<A HREF="perlfunc.htm#perlfunc_use_1">use overload</A>
, 
<A HREF="perlfunc.htm#perlfunc_no_0">no overload</A>
, and <STRONG>@ISA</STRONG> only during

<A HREF="perlfunc.htm#perlfunc_bless_1">bless</A>
ing; so if they are changed dynamically, you'll need an
additional fake 
<A HREF="perlfunc.htm#perlfunc_bless_1">bless</A>
ing to update the table.
<p>(Every SVish thing has a magic queue, and magic is an entry in that queue.
This is how a single variable may participate in multiple forms of magic
simultaneously.  For instance, environment variables regularly have two
forms at once: their <STRONG>%ENV</STRONG> magic and their taint magic.)
<p>If an object belongs to a package using overload, it carries a special
flag.  Thus the only speed penalty during arithmetic operations without
overloading is the checking of this flag.
<p>In fact, if 
<A HREF="perlfunc.htm#perlfunc_use_1">use overload</A>
 is not present, there is almost no overhead for
overloadable operations, so most programs should not suffer measurable
performance penalties.  A considerable effort was made to minimize the overhead
when overload is used and the current operation is overloadable but
the arguments in question do not belong to packages using overload.  When
in doubt, test your speed with 
<A HREF="perlfunc.htm#perlfunc_use_1">use overload</A>
 and without it.  So far there
have been no reports of substantial speed degradation if Perl is compiled
with optimization turned on.
<p>There is no size penalty for data if overload is not used. 
<p>Copying (<CODE><STRONG>$a</STRONG>=<STRONG>$b</STRONG></CODE>) is shallow; however, a one-level-deep copying is 
carried out before any operation that can imply an assignment to the
object <STRONG>$a</STRONG> (or <STRONG>$b</STRONG>) refers to, like <CODE><STRONG>$a</STRONG>++</CODE>.  You can override this
behavior by defining your own copy constructor (see <EM>``Copy Constructor''</EM>).
<p>It is expected that arguments to methods that are not explicitly supposed
to be changed are constant (but this is not enforced).
